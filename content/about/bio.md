I was born and raised in New York City. While in high school, I had the opportunity to conduct research in the Costa Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Through this experience, I developed a deep interest in the fields of tissue engineering and cardiac regeneration. I have now moved my passions over to Dublin while I pursue a degree in Biomedical Engineering from Trinity College Dublin.

During term, I work in the [Monaghan Lab](https://goolge.com) in the
Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute. During the summer I spend my
time in the Costa Lab at Mt. Sinai.
