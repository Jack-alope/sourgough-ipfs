My research centers around using human engineered cardiac tissues (hECTS)
derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a model for
the human myocardium. These 3-D tissues allow for better predicting of
clinical outcomes through testing in vitro as they more closely
resemble human cells than animal models and more complexly replicate
the human myocardium than 2-D models. These 3-D models have been used
to test various therapies in the attempt to stimulate
cardiac regeneration.
