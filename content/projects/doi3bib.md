This project aims to create arobust platform that converts object identifiers into bibtex entries compatible with LaTeX. It is a simple javascript implementation that takes a DOI and converts it to a bibtex entry reteived from either doi.org or crossref.org. It parses that entry for known errors and corrects for them so they work correctly with LaTeX.
