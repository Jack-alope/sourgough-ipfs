This was a project carried out as part of the engineering coursework
at Trinity College Dublin. We were tasked with designing a medical
device using 3D printing technologies. The device we chose to design was a stent
crimper that could be easily used on a lab bench or in the cath
lab.

###### **``3D Printable:``**

In further support of making this as accessible as possible we
designed the crimper so that it was fully 3D printable, if you can get
access to a 3D printer then you can reliably crimp stents.

###### **``Universal Design Centered:``**

The design of this project was heavily focused around the 7 core principles of universal design. A Universal Design approach helps to ensure the final product is designed with all users in mind.
