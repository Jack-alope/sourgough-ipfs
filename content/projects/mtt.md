This project aims to improve the current state of cardiac tissue
tracking systems. Human engineered cardiac tissues have become
incredibly advanced tools for modeling the human myocardium, however,
tracking systems to analyze these tissues lag behind. By improving upon the
currently available systems to allow for simultaneous multi-tissue tracking
from within an incubator this project will be able to reduce tissue
expose to movement, air temperature and composition fluctuations, and
unsterile environments.
