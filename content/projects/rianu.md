Human engineered cardiac tissues have become
incredibly advanced tools for modeling the human myocardium, however,
tracking systems to analyze these tissues lag behind. This project aims to improve the current state of cardiac tissue
tracking systems by allowing for the tracking of multiple tissues simultaneously. 

A manuscript for this project in currently in progress, upon publication all code will be released open-source.
