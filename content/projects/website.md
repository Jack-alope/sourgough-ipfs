I have made websites for various reasons-- a friend's band, a bio design
class, an art student's portfolio, and of course this one. A full
list of these can be found below. 

For sites that need to be editable by users without any programming knowledge I
use Hugo for design and deploy to netlify CMS. I also
have experience with Bootstrap Studio and most of these sites rely
heavily on bootstrap, although I am experimenting with other
frameworks such as tailwindCSS.  
  
This website has been created from scratch using Hugo as a static site
generator. The source code is available on gitlab and the custom theme
`sourgough-starter` is available for use under the MIT license.

###### **``Decentralized Web:``**  
I have been getting more interested in the decentralized internet. As a
result this website is deployed to the ipfs and accessible via the
following decentralized domains if you know how to use them.
